Project: [Library - JavaScript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)


Introduction:

This is a exercise about Objects and Object Constructors.

We'll extend the ‘Book’ example from the previous lesson and turn it into a small Library app.

Then, we'll follow the [instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library#introduction) from the assignment part of the project.

Goal:

To re-familiarize and enhance our knowledge with objects, arrays, functions and DOM.
